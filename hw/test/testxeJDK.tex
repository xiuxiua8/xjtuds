% much better:
Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive
integers, and let $c = a - b + 1$.

\item 

% Use caret `^' for superscripts and underscore `_' for subscripts.
$ y = c_2 x^2 + c_1 x + c_0 $

Use curly braces f g to group superscripts and subscripts.
$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ % ok!


There are commands for Greek letters and common notation.
$\mu = A e^{Q/RT}$

%If it's big and scary, display it on its own line using\begin{equation} and \end{equation}.

The roots of a quadratic equation

\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}
{2a}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are \ldots
