周厲王時的百姓民怨問題，歷史上最著名的故事之一，就要算周厲王禁謗了。周厲王施政暴虐，受被他寵信的大臣榮夷公唆使，改變周朝原有的制度，把平民賴以謀生的許多行業，改歸王室所有，一時間民生困苦民怨沸騰。 召公（召康公的後代穆公虎，世代輔佐王室，封地在召。今陝西岐山縣）就對周厲王説：“老百姓已經受不了啦，”厲王不聽勸諫卻採用特務手段對付人民，他派人去衞國（河南淇縣）請了很多巫師，在首都鎬京（陝西西安以西）川流不息地巡迴大街小巷，偷聽人們的談話，凡經他們指認為反叛或誹謗的人，即行下獄處決。這樣一來，舉國上下不再敢對國事評頭論足了，就是相互見面，也不亂搭腔，而是道路以目。周厲王高興地對召公説：“我能夠統一思想，不再有人敢胡言亂語。”借這機會，召公就發表一通常常被後世引用的高論：“您這是強行封老百姓的嘴，哪裏是老百姓真就沒有自己的想法了啊。要知道，防民之口，甚於防川。川壅而潰，傷人必多，老百姓也是一樣的道理啊，”但是，周厲王不聽勸告，老百姓還是敢怒不敢言。 [2] 
3年後(公元前842年)，平民們最終不堪忍受，自發地組合起來攻入王宮，把暴君放逐到一個叫彘（今屬山西）的地方。史稱“國人暴動”。
